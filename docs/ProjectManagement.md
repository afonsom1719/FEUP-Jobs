# Project Management

## Iteration 1 - Retrospective

During this iteration, the team agrees that the development of the different pages of the app itself went well, and the result is a functional app in this first release, even though some of the data is hard-coded.

However, as we are not asked to develop the _backend_ of the app, the filter feature proposed in one of the user stories seemed to be impossible to implement without the needed data (which should come from that _backend_). Facing that difficulty, we tried to create a _.json_ file to be used as a mock, but even so we could not implement that feature, and the plan is to find a solution for that problem in the next itaration so that we can implement the aforementioned user story efficiently.

Looking back at this iteration, we have mainly learned how to use many of the flutter and dart resources efficiently to build a good-looking and functional app.

As already mentioned, the main difficulty encountered by the team is being able to use consistent data that allows for efficient filtering, sorting and searching actions.
